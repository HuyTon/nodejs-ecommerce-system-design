Some popular scenarios along with system design components/features using Node.js

## 1. User Authentication and Authorization:

- Design a user authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securely managing user sessions and permissions.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to define different levels of access for users, such as customers, admins, and moderators.

  ### Design

  #### User Authentication

  - When a user logs in with valid credentials, the server generates a JWT token containing the user's ID and role.
  - The JWT token is sent back to the client and stored securely (e.g., in local storage or cookies).
  - For subsequent requests, the client includes the JWT token in the Authorization header.

  #### User Authorization:

  - The server verifies the JWT token for each protected route to ensure the user is authenticated.
  - If the token is valid, the server extracts the user's role from the token and checks if the user has permission to access the requested resource.
  - Access control is enforced based on predefined roles and permissions.

## 2. Product Catalog Management:

- Design a scalable product catalog management system to store and retrieve product information, including details like name, description, price, and inventory.
- Utilize a NoSQL database like MongoDB to store product data in a flexible and scalable manner.

## 3. Order Processing and Fulfillment:

- Implement an order processing system to handle customer orders, including order placement, payment processing, and order fulfillment.
- Integrate with third-party payment gateways for securely processing online payments.
  Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for asynchronous order processing and decoupling of components.

## 4. Search and Recommendation Engine:

- Design a search and recommendation engine to help users discover products based on their preferences and browsing history.
- Utilize Elasticsearch or a similar search engine for fast and efficient product search capabilities.
- Implement personalized recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering or content-based filtering) to suggest relevant products to users.

## 5. Real-Time Chat and Notifications:

- Implement real-time chat functionality to facilitate communication between customers and support agents.
- Use WebSockets or a pub/sub messaging system (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub) for real-time messaging between clients and servers.
- Implement push notifications to alert users about order updates, promotions, and other important events.

## 6. Analytics and Monitoring:

- Design an analytics and monitoring system to track key metrics such as website traffic, conversion rates, and user engagement.
- Utilize tools like Google Analytics or custom analytics solutions for collecting and analyzing data.
- Implement logging and monitoring using tools like Winston or Log4js to track system performance and detect issues in real-time.

## 7. Scalability and High Availability:

- Design a horizontally scalable architecture to handle increasing traffic and user demand.
  Utilize containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes for managing and scaling application instances.
- Implement load balancing and auto-scaling to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances and ensure high availability.

## 8. Security and Data Protection:

- Implement security best practices such as input validation, output encoding, and parameterized queries to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Use HTTPS for secure communication over the web and encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Implement rate limiting, captcha verification, and other measures to prevent abuse and protect against malicious attacks.

## 9. Design a recommendation system:

- Data Collection and Preparation:

  - Collect data on user interactions with products, such as views, purchases, ratings, and reviews.
  - Gather data on product attributes, categories, descriptions, and other relevant information.
  - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

- Recommendation Algorithms:

  - Choose recommendation algorithms based on your data and objectives. Common algorithms include collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.
  - Implement the selected algorithms using libraries or custom implementations in Node.js.

- Data Modeling and Training:

  - Build user-item interaction matrices or feature vectors to represent the data.
  - Train recommendation models using the prepared data and chosen algorithms.
  - Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.

## 10. Design a Web Crawler scalable service:

Design a Web Crawler scalable service that collects information (crawls) from the entire web and fetches hundreds of millions of web documents.

### Components:

- Task Queue:

  - Acts as a central queue to distribute URLs to be crawled among multiple crawler instances.
  - Utilizes a message broker such as RabbitMQ to manage the queuing and consumption of crawl tasks.

- Crawler Instance:

  - Represents a single instance of the crawler application running on a separate machine or container.
  - Fetches URLs from the task queue, retrieves web pages, and extracts relevant information.

- Fetcher/HTTP Client:

  - Handles HTTP requests and responses for fetching web pages from remote servers.
  - Implements features like retries, timeouts, and error handling to ensure robustness.

- HTML Parser:

  - Parses the HTML content of fetched web pages to extract structured data and relevant URLs.
  - Utilizes libraries like BeautifulSoup or lxml in Python or Cheerio in Node.js for efficient parsing.

- Storage System:

  - Stores crawled web documents and associated metadata in a distributed storage system.
  - Uses scalable storage solutions such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or HDFS to handle large volumes of data.
