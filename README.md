Some popular scenarios along with system design components/features using Node.js

## User Authentication and Authorization:

- Design a user authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securely managing user sessions and permissions.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to define different levels of access for users, such as customers, admins, and moderators.

### Design

#### User Authentication

    - When a user logs in with valid credentials, the server generates a JWT token containing the user's ID and role.
    - The JWT token is sent back to the client and stored securely (e.g., in local storage or cookies).
    - For subsequent requests, the client includes the JWT token in the Authorization header.

#### User Authorization:

    - The server verifies the JWT token for each protected route to ensure the user is authenticated.
    - If the token is valid, the server extracts the user's role from the token and checks if the user has permission to access the requested resource.
    - Access control is enforced based on predefined roles and permissions.

## Product Catalog Management:

- Design a scalable product catalog management system to store and retrieve product information, including details like name, description, price, and inventory.
- Utilize a NoSQL database like MongoDB to store product data in a flexible and scalable manner.

## Order Processing and Fulfillment:

- Implement an order processing system to handle customer orders, including order placement, payment processing, and order fulfillment.
- Integrate with third-party payment gateways for securely processing online payments.
  Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for asynchronous order processing and decoupling of components.

## Search and Recommendation Engine:

- Design a search and recommendation engine to help users discover products based on their preferences and browsing history.
- Utilize Elasticsearch or a similar search engine for fast and efficient product search capabilities.
- Implement personalized recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering or content-based filtering) to suggest relevant products to users.

## Real-Time Chat and Notifications:

- Implement real-time chat functionality to facilitate communication between customers and support agents.
- Use WebSockets or a pub/sub messaging system (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub) for real-time messaging between clients and servers.
- Implement push notifications to alert users about order updates, promotions, and other important events.

## Analytics and Monitoring:

- Design an analytics and monitoring system to track key metrics such as website traffic, conversion rates, and user engagement.
- Utilize tools like Google Analytics or custom analytics solutions for collecting and analyzing data.
- Implement logging and monitoring using tools like Winston or Log4js to track system performance and detect issues in real-time.

## Scalability and High Availability:

- Design a horizontally scalable architecture to handle increasing traffic and user demand.
  Utilize containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes for managing and scaling application instances.
- Implement load balancing and auto-scaling to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances and ensure high availability.

## Security and Data Protection:

- Implement security best practices such as input validation, output encoding, and parameterized queries to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Use HTTPS for secure communication over the web and encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Implement rate limiting, captcha verification, and other measures to prevent abuse and protect against malicious attacks.
